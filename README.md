## Overview

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hridya Umesh â€” someone who's deeply passionate about cloud computing and big data technologies. I love building data-driven solutions that make an impact, especially when it involves streaming, transforming, and analyzing large volumes of information in real-time.

On my GitHub, youâ€™ll find projects that reflect my interest in AWS, data pipelines, and working with tools like Kafka, Spark, and Python. I'm always exploring new technologies and ways to optimize data workflows for better efficiency and insights.
